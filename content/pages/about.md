Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saurabh, a software engineer based around Mumbai in India. Presently, I am working as a remote and freelance web developer creating software solutions that help my clients grow their business.

I have been involved in software development professionally since more than 9 years. I started out working for a reputed IT company as a Software Engineer and later as a Senior Software Engineer. I worked on various enterprise level applications as a part of a large team. Around 6 years ago, I co-founded my own Software Development firm, CodeSphere Solutions. I juggled many roles but was mainly involved in web development.

My paid work currently involves programming backends using Coldfusion or PHP and SQL Server. Front-ends mostly involve jQuery and Angular and arranging layouts using Twitter Bootstrap.

My programming language of interest is Javascript and I enjoy exploring it in detail. I love working on personal or hobby projects using React and React Native. Nowadays, I am also getting my hands dirty with some NodeJS.
