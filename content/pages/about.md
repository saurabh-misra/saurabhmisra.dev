Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I am Saurabh Misra, a freelance software engineer based in Mumbai, India. I have been involved in software development professionally since more than 9 years. I started out working for a highly reputed IT company as a Senior Software Engineer, working on different enterprise level applications as a part of a large team. Around 6 years ago, I co-founded my own IT consulting and outsourcing firm, CodeSphere Solutions, where I handled many roles but was mainly involved in web development. Presently, I am working as a remote freelancer doing what I do best, creating software solutions that help my clients grow their business.
