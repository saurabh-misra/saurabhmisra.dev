Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Saurabh, a software engineer based in Mumbai, India. I am currently working as a remote and freelance web developer creating software solutions that help my clients grow their businesses.

I have been involved in software development professionally since more than 11 years. I started out working for <a href="https://infosys.com">Infosys<i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i></a> as a Software Engineer and later as a Senior Software Engineer. 

Around 6 years ago, I co-founded my own Software Development firm, CodeSphere Solutions where I juggled many roles but was mainly involved in web development.

My paid work involves programming backends using Coldfusion or PHP and SQL Server. Front-ends mostly involve jQuery, React or Angular and arranging layouts using Twitter Bootstrap.

In my free time, I like working on hobby projects or writing about what I learn. My programming language of interest is JavaScript and I enjoy exploring it in detail. I love using React and React Native for web and mobile app development. Nowadays, I am also getting my hands dirty with some NodeJS.
