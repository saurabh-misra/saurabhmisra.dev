Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m **Saurabh Misra**, a software engineer based in Mumbai, India. 

<img src="me.jpg" width="100%" />

I am currently working as a remote and freelance web developer creating software solutions that help my clients grow their businesses.

I have been involved in software development professionally since more than 12 years. 

I started out working for <a href="https://infosys.com">Infosys<i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i></a> as a Software Engineer and later as a Senior Software Engineer. 

Around 6 years ago, I co-founded my own Software Development firm, CodeSphere Solutions where I juggled many roles but was mainly involved in web development.

As a part of my current paid work, I get to work on server-side technologies like PHP, Coldfusion, Wordpress and SQL Server. Front-ends mostly involve working on jQuery, React, Angular and Twitter Bootstrap.

In my free time, I like working on hobby projects or writing and sharing about what I learn here on this blog. 

My language of interest is JavaScript and I enjoy exploring it in detail. I love using React and React Native for web and mobile app development. Nowadays, I am also getting my hands dirty with some NodeJS.
