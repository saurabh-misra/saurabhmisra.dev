This is just a quick tip in case you're facing the same issue as I did today. I was trying to setup a redirect on Netlify for my Gatsby site. I read in Netlify's [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file) that one of the options to setup redirects is to use a `_redirects` file. I went ahead with this option and placed this file with my redirects at the root of my Gatsby site codebase and published it and it didn't work.ðŸ˜ž 

A bit of googling around revealed that we need to take care of two things to make this work.

#### 1. You should have `gatsby-plugin-netlify` installed. 
I already had this installed so no further action was required on my end. If you don't have this installed then you can install this using the following command.

```
npm install gatsby-plugin-netlify
```

#### 2. Place your `_redirects` file in a folder called `static` at the root of your Gatsby codebase 

If this directory does not exist then create it.

This works because Netlify requires that the `_redirects` file should be placed inside your web root, not your gatsby codebase. Gatsby builds your site from your source code and then places all the publicly accessible files in a `public` directory which becomes the web root of your site. This is where we would want to place our `_redirects` file. But Netlify builds the gatsby site for us dynamically so we have no way to specify that we want to place this file in our web root. 

But luckily for us, the contents of the `static` folder are moved to the web root during the build step. We can verify this locally by executing the `gatsby develop` command. 

After adding the `_redirects` file to the `static` folder, run `gatsby develop` and when it's done running, you'll be able to see the `_redirects` file automatically added to your `public` folder.

This is what worked for me and hopefully it'll work for you too.
