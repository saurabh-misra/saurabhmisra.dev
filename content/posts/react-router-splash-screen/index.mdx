**In this post, we'll learn how to show a splash screen in a React and React Router app when the page initially loads and when it subsequently reloads.**

A splash screen is just a simple page with a static or animated app logo and/or another loading indicator to indicate that the app is initializing. 

A React Router app will mostly be built as an SPA or a Single Page Application so once the page loads, all route or page transitions *from within the app* will not actually reload the page but will simply render a different route or page component and React Router will take care of changing the URL accordingly.

There are <Link to="/react-router-loading-indicators">several different ways to show loading indicators for such, *internal* route/page transitions</Link> but when the page is loaded for the first time or it reloads, we need to employ a different strategy.

The way React Router works is that when the page loads initially or on reload, the `loader()` function for the current route gets invoked and if it involves doing something time-consuming like an HTTP AJAX call, then it takes some time for the `loader()` to finish processing and render the route component. Till then, React Router will not display anything and the browser window will just appear blank.

This is the problem that this tutorial will help us find a solution to. Instead of displaying nothing in this situation, we'll display a simple splash screen to make sure that the user doesn't get confused about whether the app is loading properly or not. 

This is the result of the code we're going to learn to write in this post.

You can download or clone the full code for this tutorial from <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/react-router-splash-screen-tutorial/" target="_blank">this github repo</a>. Once you have the codebase, open your terminal and run `npm i` to install dependencies. After this, run `npm run dev` to start a localhost server.

>This post assumes basic working knowledge of React and React Router.

Lets look at the `/src/main.jsx` file. 

```jsx title=/src/main.jsx highlight=17
const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <Root />,
        children: [
            {
                path: "/",
                element: <Home />,
                loader: homeLoader
            }
        ]
    }
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App router={router} />
    </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

Normally, we'd have rendered `<RouterProvider />` directly in place of our `<App />` component but since we need to show a splash screen, we have included `<App />`.

Before we look at `/src/App.jsx`, lets have a quick look at `/src/Root.jsx` and `/src/Home.jsx`.

The `<Root />` route component will simply act as a parent route that will dump its child route components into `<Outlet />`.

```jsx title=/src/Root.jsx
export default function Root() {
    return (
        <>
            <Outlet />
        </>
    );
}
```

The `<Home />` route component has a `loader()` function that makes an API call to fetch data. Once the data is loaded, the `<Card />` component will be hydrated with `data` and will be rendered on screen.

```jsx title=/src/Home.jsx highlight=2,6,14
export async function loader() {
    return await getData();
}

export default function Home() {
    const data = useLoaderData();

    return (
        <>
            <div className="container mt-5 text-start">
                <div className="row">
                    <div className="col">
                        <h1>Home Page</h1>
                        <Card {...data} />
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

## Splash Screen
Open `/src/App.jsx`. This is where all the work happens related to showing and hiding the splash screen. Please go through the comments to understand what each line of code is doing.

```jsx
export default function App({ router }) {
    const [showSplashScreen, setShowSplashScreen] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        /*
        Since the `useNavigation()` hook is not available outside `<RouterProvider />`,
        this component won't re-render automatically when the navigation state changes.
        So we set up an interval that will keep checking whether the navigation state 
        within `router` has changed.
        */
        const splashScreenInterval = setInterval(
            () => {
                /*
                Normally, we'd be able to reference `navigation.state` directly using 
                `useNavigation()`. But since we are outside `<RouterProvider />`, 
                we only have the `router` object to provide us with the navigation state.
                */
                const navState = router.state.navigation.state;

                /*
                When the page loads initially or on reload, navState will be "loading". 
                This is when we'll show the Splash Screen.
                Once the `loader()` has completed its processing i.e. once the data is 
                fetched from the API, `navState` will change from "loading" to "idle". 
                This is when we'll hide the Splash Screen and render the actual page.
                */
                if( navState == "idle" ){
                    // Hide the splash screen.
                    setShowSplashScreen(false);
                    clearInterval( splashScreenInterval )
                }
            }, 1000);

        // cleanup in case of component unmount
        () => clearInterval( splashScreenInterval );
    }, []);

    return (
        <>
            {
                showSplashScreen ? <SplashScreen /> : <RouterProvider router={router} />
            }
        </>
    );
}
```

And that's pretty much it! Once data is fetched, the `<SplashScreen />` component will be unmounted and `<RouterProvider />` will be mounted and rendered and the page will be displayed.

Hope this helps!üôè
