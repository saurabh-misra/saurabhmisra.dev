This is just a quick tip for anyone looking to customize the headers on a table configured with the <a href="https://datatables.net/" target="_blank">jQuery DataTable plugin</a> and also as a quicker way for my future self to find this information.

The other day I received request to add a dropdown filter in the header of a table that I had configured with the DataTable plugin.

The setup before the customization is pretty basic with the table and the usual DataTable initialization script. Here is <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/saurabhmisra87/nL7j4p08/2/" target="_blank">a jsfiddle</a> with a full working example. 

```js
$("table.my-table").DataTable({});
```

Now to replace one of the headers with a `<select>` that will act as filter, we need to add the below script to the initialization statement. I have added comments to explain what each line is doing. Here is <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/saurabhmisra87/pgL1yv95/16/" target="_blank">a jsfiddle</a> with a full working example.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("table.my-table").DataTable({
    // execute callback when DataTable is completely initialiazed
    "initComplete": function() {
      // Select the column whose header we need replaced using its index(0 based)
      this.api().column(2).every(function() {
        var column = this;
        // Put the HTML of the <select /> filter along with any default options 
        var select = $('<select class="form-control input-sm"><option value="">All</option></select>')
          // remove all content from this column's header and 
          // append the above <select /> element HTML code into it 
          .appendTo($(column.header()).empty())
          // execute callback when an option is selected in our <select /> filter
          .on('change', function() {
            // escape special characters for DataTable to perform search
            var val = $.fn.dataTable.util.escapeRegex(
              $(this).val()
            );

            // Perform the search with the <select /> filter value and re-render the DataTable
            column
              .search(val ? '^' + val + '$' : '', true, false)
              .draw();
          });
        // fill the <select /> filter with unique values from the column's data
        column.data().unique().sort().each(function(d, j) {
          select.append("<option value='" + d + "'>" + d + "</option>")
        });
      });
    },
    // disable sorting on the column with the filter in its header.
    "columnDefs": [{
      targets: [2],
      orderable: false
    }]
  });
});
```
