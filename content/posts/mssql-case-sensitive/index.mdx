So the other day I was tasked with running a search in SQL Server to find all rows in a particular entity table with a particular column called `status` set to **ACTIVE** in all caps.

Most of the rows in this table had the value as `Active` for the `status` column but I was not sure whether it also had value as `ACTIVE`.

So first I ran a query to find all distinct status values. 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT [status] 
FROM (
  SELECT 'Active' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 'Active' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 'ACTIVE' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 'Active' as status
) temp

/* OUTPUT:

status
------
Active

*/
```

Did you see what happened? The all caps `ACTIVE` value is just ignored and we only get the other value in the result set.

This is because most SQL Server installations are *case-insensitive*.

So if you run a query like this to return only those rows with `status` set to `ACTIVE` in all caps, it won't work. It'll return rows with `status` column value set to `Active` and `ACTIVE` both.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT 1 as id, 'Active' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 2 as id, 'Active' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 3 as id, 'ACTIVE' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 4 as id, 'Active' as status
) temp
WHERE [status] = 'ACTIVE';

/* OUTPUT:

id          status
----------- ------
1           Active
2           Active
3           ACTIVE
4           Active

*/
```

### Enter, SQL Server Collations
Collations are a set of rules in SQL Server for storing and fetching data. These rules are defined on a server, database or column level and can even be specified in queries.

The two main collations we need to know at this point are:

- `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` where CI stands for **c**ase-**i**nsensitive
- `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS` where CS stands for **c**ase-**s**ensitive

So how can we use this to make our search case-sensitive? The answer is using the `COLLATE` clause.

### `COLLATE` clause

We can make our search queries run case-sensitively by using the `COLLATE` clause followed by the name of the case-sensitive collation like this:

```sql {11}
SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT 1 as id, 'Active' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 2 as id, 'Active' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 3 as id, 'ACTIVE' as status
  UNION
  SELECT 4 as id, 'Active' as status
) temp
WHERE [status] = 'ACTIVE' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS;

/* OUTPUT:

id          status
----------- ------
3           ACTIVE

*/
```

Woo hoo!ðŸ¤˜ Mission accomplished! We now get only those rows that have `status` column value as all caps `ACTIVE`.

### Helpful tips
We can also find out the collation specified for servers, databases and columns using these helpful T-SQL queries.

```sql
-- Server-Level Collation
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('collation') AS 'Server Collation';

-- Database-Level Collation
SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(
  '<your-database-name>', 
  'Collation'
) AS 'Database Collation';

-- Column-Level Collation
SELECT 
    name as 'Column', 
    collation_name as 'Column Collation'
FROM sys.columns 
WHERE name = N'<your-column-name>';
```
