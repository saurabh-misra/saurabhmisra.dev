**In this tutorial, we'll learn how to implement Infinite Scrolling, similar to a Social Media Feed, in React using a third-party library called <a href="https://github.com/ankeetmaini/react-infinite-scroll-component" target="_blank">"react-infinite-scroll-component"</a>.**

You can download or clone the completed code for this tutorial from <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/react-infinite-scroll" target="_blank">this github repo</a>. In your terminal, `cd` into the tutorial directory and run `npm i` followed by `npm run dev` which should start a localhost web server. If you visit the localhost URL, you'll see this output.

Lets look at the code to understand how to implement this. Open `/src/App.jsx` in your code editor.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InfiniteScroll from "react-infinite-scroll-component";

export default function App() {
    const [ data, setData ] = useState( [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] );
    const MAX_DATA = 30;
    const hasMore = data.length < MAX_DATA;

    function fetchData( limit=10 ){
        const start = data.length + 1;
        const end = (data.length + limit) >= MAX_DATA 
                    ? MAX_DATA 
                    : (data.length + limit);
        let newData = [ ...data ];
        
        for( var i = start ; i <= end ; i++ ) {
            newData = [ ...newData, i ];
        }
    
        // fake delay to simulate a time-consuming network request
        setTimeout( () => setData( newData ), 1500 );
    }

    return (
        <InfiniteScroll
            dataLength={ data.length }
            next={fetchData}
            hasMore={hasMore}
            loader={<p className="text-center m-5">‚è≥&nbsp;Loading...</p>}
            endMessage={<p className="text-center m-5">That&apos;s all folks!üê∞ü•ï</p>}
            style={{ overflow: "visible" }}
            >
            {
                data.map( d => (
                    <div className="card mb-4" key={d} style={{width: "18rem", margin: "auto"}}>
                        <div className="card-header">Card#{d}</div>
                        <div className="card-body">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</div>
                    </div>
                ))
            }
        </InfiniteScroll>
    )
}
```

We use the `<InfiniteScroll />` component from the "react-infinite-scroll-component" library. It has various props that help customize the behaviour according to our needs. 

The `dataLength` prop takes a value for the number of items within the scroll component.

The `next` prop is a function reference which is invoked to fetch the next set of data when the scrolling happens.

The `hasMore` prop takes a boolean value and determines whether there is a next set of data available. If yes then the function reference in the `next` prop will be invoked when the scrolling happens otherwise the element in the prop `endMessage` will be displayed.

The `loader` prop is a loading indicator element that is displayed while the next set of data is being fetched.

The `endMessage` prop represents an element that is displayed when the scrolling reaches its end and there are no more items to display.

In the above example, we start with an initial list of 10 items ( the numbers 1 to 10 ). We define a function `fetchData()` which generates future sets of data when scrolling happens. We also define a limit, `MAX_DATA`, of 30 items so that the list cannot scroll beyond that point. 

Within the `<InfiniteScroll />` component, we `map()` through the array of items and render a list of Card elements.

And that's it! As you can see, the library makes it pretty simple and straight-forward to implement infinite scrolling in React.

Hope this helps!üôè
