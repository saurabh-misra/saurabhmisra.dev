**This tutorial will teach you how to setup a staging environment in a <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a> server.**

>This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with Vite and that you have already setup a Vite server locally. If you haven't, then please read <Link to="/create-new-react-app-2024">"How to setup a React+Vite server"</Link> before proceeding with this tutorial.

Out of the box, Vite supports two modes: `development` and `production`.

The `dev` command runs your app in `development` mode.

The `build` and `preview` commands run your app in `production` mode.

The `import.meta.env.MODE` variable holds the value of the mode the Vite server is currently operating in and can be used to run environment specific code.

For example:

```js
if( import.meta.env.MODE == "development" ) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

Vite will replace this variable with its respective value during the build process and your conditions will work properly in every mode.

We can set a custom value for the mode by passing in a `--mode` flag while executing our CLI commands.

Lets see how we can use this functionality to set up a `staging` mode.

Add these scripts to `package.json`.

```js title=package.json highlight=3-4
{
    scripts: {
        "staging": "vite --mode staging",
        "build-staging": "vite build --mode staging"
    }
}
```

If you now run `npm run staging`, it will start a dev server BUT in `staging` mode.

If you run `npm run build-staging`, it'll build your site in `staging` mode.

That's it! We have just created a working staging mode for your web app.

## Tip #1: Create separate distributions for staging and production

In case you want to maintain separate distribution folders for staging and production, then that is possible as well.

Open your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts` file and change your `defineConfig()` to take a function as an argument instead of an object. Vite will automatically pass in the `mode` value to this function. Using `mode` and the `build.outDir` option, you can set different distribution directories for `staging` and `production` 

```js title=vite.config.js highlight=1-3,7
export default defineConfig( ({ mode }) => {
    // build into different folders depending on the `mode`.
    const outDir = (mode === "staging") ? "./dist/staging/" : "./dist/production/";

    return {
        plugins: [react()],
        build: { outDir }
    }
})
```

Also, go ahead and add another script to preview your staging build in your `package.json`.

```js title=package.json highlight=5
{
    scripts: {
        "staging": "npm run dev --mode staging",
        "build-staging": "npm run build --mode staging",
        "preview-staging": "vite preview --mode staging"
    }
}
```

All done!! Now your server will build and preview different distribution directories for staging and production.

## Tip #2: Create environment settings specific to the staging mode

You can do this by creating an `.env.staging` file in the root of the Vite server setup. In here, you can add your environment settings specific to the staging site.

```text title=.env.staging
VITE_SOME_KEY=SOME_VALUE
```

Just remember to prefix your environment variables with the prefix "VITE_" or else they won't be available in your code. This is to prevent accidentally making environment variables accessible to the client code.

In case you want to change this prefix, you can do so using the `envPrefix` option in `vite.config.js` like this.

```js title=vite.config.js highlight=8
export default defineConfig( ({ mode }) => {
    // build into different folders depending on the `mode`.
    const outDir = (mode === "staging") ? "./dist/staging/" : "./dist/production/";

    return {
        plugins: [react()],
        build: { outDir },
        envPrefix: "MYAPP_"
    }
})
```

And then you can name your environment variables as `MYAPP_SOME_KEY=SOME_VALUE`.

Hope this helps!üôè
