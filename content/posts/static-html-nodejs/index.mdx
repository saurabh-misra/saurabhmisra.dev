## Introduction
I recently came across a situation where I had to serve a static HTML page from an API powered by ExpressJS on a NodeJS server. 

This was a simple but interesting problem and I thought about documenting this in one place for my future self or for anybody else in the same situation as me looking for a solution and a straight-forward explanation. 

## Tutorial Project Setup
Download or clone the tutorial files from <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/static-html-nodejs-tutorial" target="_blank">this github repo</a>.

The project comprises of a basic NodeJS and ExpressJS setup. There is a `server.js` file which has the code to initialize the server. There is a `/public` folder which contains our static HTML, CSS, JS and media files.

Run `npm i` to install dependencies and then `npm start` to start the server.

The project will also install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon" target="_blank">nodemon</a> which will automatically restart the server for you whenever you make any changes to the files in the project.

## Render the HTML page
If you visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/</a> right now in the browser, you won't see anything because the API root endpoint is not returning any response.

What we want is that this URL should render our static html: `/public/index.html`.

Open `server.js` in your editor and replace the definition of the root API service handler with this.

```js
app.get( "/", ( req, res ) => {
  // send the HTML file in the API response
  res.sendFile( path.join( __dirname + "/public/index.html" ));
});
```

The `sendFile()` method, as the name suggests will send the HTML file as the response. The `Content-Type` will automatically be set to `text/html`.

If you visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/</a>, you should be able to see the HTML page.

But our CSS, JS and media files are not rendered properly. If you look at the Console in Dev Tools, you'll see errors like this:

<img src={staticAssetsLoadingIssue} width="100%" alt="screenshot showing errors while loading static assets in browser console" />

The cause of these issues is that ExpressJS is unaware of the existence of these static assets in the `/public` directory. To make it aware, we need to use the middleware returned by `express.static()`.

Copy paste this entire code into your `server.js` file.

```js highlight=7,11
const express = require( "express" ),
  app = express(),
  path = require( "path" ),
  PORT = 3000;

// register the location of the static assets
app.use( express.static( 'public' ));

app.get( "/", ( req, res ) => {
  // send the HTML file in the API response
  res.sendFile( path.join( __dirname + "/public/index.html" ));
});

// Start the API server!
app.listen( PORT, () => console.log( `ðŸ‘‚ API server listening on port ${ PORT }` ) );
```

`express.static()` takes in the location of the folder that contains the static files as an input argument. 

If you reload the page, you should now be able to see the properly rendered page with all static assets in placeðŸŽ‰.
