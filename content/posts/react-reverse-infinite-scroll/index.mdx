**In this tutorial, we'll learn how to implement Reverse Infinite Scrolling, similar to a Chat-app, in React using a third-party library called <a href="https://github.com/ankeetmaini/react-infinite-scroll-component" target="_blank">"react-infinite-scroll-component"</a>.**

You can download or clone the completed code for this tutorial from <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/react-reverse-infinite-scroll" target="_blank">this github repo</a>. In your terminal, `cd` into the tutorial directory and run `npm i` followed by `npm run dev` which should start a localhost web server. If you visit the localhost URL, you'll see this output.

Lets look at the code to understand how to implement this. Open `/src/App.jsx` in your code editor.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InfiniteScroll from "react-infinite-scroll-component";

export default function App() {
    const [ data, setData ] = useState( [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] );
    const MAX_DATA = 30;
    const hasMore = data.length < MAX_DATA;

    function fetchData( limit=10 ){
        const start = data.length + 1;
        const end = (data.length + limit) >= MAX_DATA 
                    ? MAX_DATA 
                    : (data.length + limit);
        let newData = [ ...data ];
        
        for( var i = start ; i <= end ; i++ ) {
            newData = [ ...newData, i ];
        }
    
        // fake delay to simulate a time-consuming network request
        setTimeout( () => setData( newData ), 1500 );
    }

    return (
        <div id="scrollableDiv" style={{width: "500px", height: "100vh", overflowY: "scroll", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column-reverse", margin: "auto"}} className="bg-body-tertiary p-3">
            <InfiniteScroll
                dataLength={ data.length }
                next={fetchData}
                hasMore={hasMore}
                loader={<p className="text-center m-5">‚è≥&nbsp;Loading...</p>}
                endMessage={<p className="text-center m-5">That&apos;s all folks!üê∞ü•ï</p>}
                style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column-reverse", overflow: "visible" }}
                scrollableTarget="scrollableDiv"
                inverse={true}
                >
                {
                    data.map( d => (
                        <div className="card mb-4" key={d} style={{width: "18rem"}}>
                            <div className="card-header">Card#{d}</div>
                            <div className="card-body">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</div>
                        </div>
                    ))
                }
            </InfiniteScroll>
        </div>
    )
}
```

I have already explained how normal Infinite scrolling can be implemented using this library in my [previous blog post](/react-infinite-scroll) where I have also explained the purpose of most of the attributes of the `<InfiniteScroll />` component used above.

The attributes that are specific to the reverse scroll scenario are `inverse` and `scrollableTarget`.

The `inverse` attribute should be set to `true` to make sure the items appear in the reverse sequence.

The `scrollableTarget` attribute takes the ID of an element as its value. By default, the scrollable target is the document or the `<body />`. With the `scrollableTarget` attribute, we can specify a custom DOM element as the container for housing the infinite scroll behaviour. In our tutorial, the div with ID `scrollableDiv` is the value of the `scrollableTarget` attribute. If you notice in the browser output, the main scroll bar to the right of the browser is missing and instead the scroll happens on `scrollableDiv`.

Now the other aspect of making scrolling work in reverse is the CSS part. 

You'll notice we have CSS styles defined for the `<InfiniteScroll />` component and on `#scrollableDiv`. These CSS styles are required for the reverse behaviour to work properly. 

Assuming, your data in `data` is a list of entries in descending order ( of creation ), normally you'd have the latest created item on top. But with `flex-direction: column-reverse` on the `<InfiniteScroll />` component, this sequence is reversed so that the latest created item appears last. And the same `flex-direction: column-reverse` styling is also applied to `#scrollableDiv` so that the scroll bar sticks to the bottom of the list rather than to the top.

You can of course customize the width of the `#scrollableDiv` and choose to not have everything centered by removing `margin:auto` but the rest of the styles should remain as is.

The classes are <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a> specific and you can remove them with your classes or inline styles to achieve a similar CSS effect.

And that's it! With <a href="https://github.com/ankeetmaini/react-infinite-scroll-component" target="_blank">"react-infinite-scroll-component"</a>, it becomes pretty simple and straight-forward to implement Chat-app like scrolling behaviour quickly.

Hope this helps!üôè
