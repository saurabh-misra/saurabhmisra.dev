In PHP, when looping over an array of objects( or an associative array ), the objects are passed by value. So if you update this object within the `foreach` loop, the original array remains unchanged.

For example:

```php
<?php
$arrUsers = [
    [ "id" => 1, "name" => "Gurunath" ],
    [ "id" => 2, "name" => "Roopesh" ],
    [ "id" => 3, "name" => "Sanil" ]
];

// `$user` is being passed by value
foreach( $arrUsers as $user ) {
    $user[ "isActive" ] = 1;
}

print_r( $arrUsers );
?>

/*
Array ( 
    [0] => Array ( [id] => 1 [name] => Gurunath ) 
    [1] => Array ( [id] => 2 [name] => Roopesh ) 
    [2] => Array ( [id] => 3 [name] => Sanil ) 
) 
*/
```

Even though you are adding another key-value , `isActive` to `$user` within the `foreach` loop, the original array `$arrUsers` remains unchanged.

This happens because `$user` is being passed by value and not by reference in the `foreach` loop initialization statement.

In order to pass `$user` by reference, we need to append `&` before `$user` when initializing the `foreach` loop. Lets see this in action.

```php highlight=9
<?php
$arrUsers = [
    [ "id" => 1, "name" => "Gurunath" ],
    [ "id" => 2, "name" => "Roopesh" ],
    [ "id" => 3, "name" => "Sanil" ]
];

// `$user` is being passed by reference
foreach( $arrUsers as &$user ) {
    $user[ "isActive" ] = 1;
}

print_r( $arrUsers );
?>

/*
Array ( 
    [0] => Array ( [id] => 1 [name] => Gurunath [isActive] => 1 ) 
    [1] => Array ( [id] => 2 [name] => Roopesh  [isActive] => 1 ) 
    [2] => Array ( [id] => 3 [name] => Sanil    [isActive] => 1 ) 
) 
*/
```

Now the original array gets updated as expected.

Hope this helps!üôè
