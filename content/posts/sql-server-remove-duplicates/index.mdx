**In this tutorial, we'll look at four different ways to delete duplicate records from a table in SQL Server.**

In most cases where you need to delete duplicates, you'd come with a criteria to either delete the most recent or the oldest and keep just the one original record.

Lets look at both these scenarios and apply two different approaches to them both.

We'll first quickly setup a table with some duplicate records for our demo purposes. With the below setup code, we'll create a table that will hold user data mainly the "email". We are intentionally going to insert duplicate records with the same email address.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl_users(
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT( getdate() )
);

INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'abhishek@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'abhishek@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'abhishek@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'ganesh@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'ganesh@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'ganesh@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'ganesh@example.com' );
INSERT INTO tbl_users( email ) VALUES( 'atul@example.com' ); 
```

After setting this up, the table data will look something like this.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_users;

/*
id          email                     created_at
----------- ------------------------- -----------------------
1           abhishek@example.com      2024-07-04 13:00:00:000
2           abhishek@example.com      2024-07-04 14:00:00:000
3           abhishek@example.com      2024-07-04 15:00:00:000
4           ganesh@example.com        2024-07-04 16:00:00:000
5           ganesh@example.com        2024-07-04 17:00:00:000
6           ganesh@example.com        2024-07-04 18:00:00:000
7           ganesh@example.com        2024-07-04 19:00:00:000
8           atul@example.com          2024-07-04 20:00:00:000
*/
```

## 1. Retain oldest record and delete other duplicate records

We'll first see how we can delete most recent records and retain the oldest one as the original record.

So using both approaches mentioned below, you'll end up deleting 5 records from our demo table and will be left with the below records.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_users;

/*
id          email                       created_at
----------- --------------------------- -----------------------
2           abhishek@example.com        2024-07-06 13:00:00:000
5           ganesh@example.com          2024-07-06 16:00:00:000
7           atul@example.com            2024-07-06 20:00:00:000
*/
```

### 1.1. Using `MIN()`

```sql
DELETE u1
FROM tbl_users u1
WHERE u1.created_at > ( 
    SELECT MIN(u2.created_at) 
    FROM tbl_users u2 
    WHERE u2.email = u1.email 
)
```

### 1.2. Using `ROW_NUMBER()`

```sql
DELETE 
FROM tbl_users
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM (
        SELECT 
            *, 
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( 
                PARTITION BY email ORDER BY created_at ASC 
            ) as 'row_num'
        FROM tbl_users
    ) temp
    WHERE row_num > 1
)
```

## 2. Retain newest record and delete other duplicate records

We'll now look at how we can delete oldest records and retain the most recent one as the original record.

So using both approaches mentioned below, you'll end up deleting 5 records from our demo table and will be left with the below records.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_users;

/*
id          email                       created_at
----------- --------------------------- -----------------------
2           abhishek@example.com        2024-07-06 15:00:00:000
5           ganesh@example.com          2024-07-06 19:00:00:000
7           atul@example.com            2024-07-06 20:00:00:000
*/
```

### 2.1. Using `MAX()`

```sql
DELETE u1
FROM tbl_users u1
WHERE u1.created_at < ( 
    SELECT MAX(u2.created_at) 
    FROM tbl_users u2 
    WHERE u2.email = u1.email 
)
```

### 2.2. Using `ROW_NUMBER()`

```sql
DELETE 
FROM tbl_users
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM (
        SELECT 
            *, 
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( 
                PARTITION BY email ORDER BY created_at DESC 
            ) as 'row_num'
        FROM tbl_users
    ) temp
    WHERE row_num > 1
)
```

Hope this helps!üôè
