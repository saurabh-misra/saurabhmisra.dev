In this blog post, we'll look at two different ways we can download files from a NodeJS and ExpressJS powered REST API. They are:

- Using `res.sendFile()`
- Using `res.download()`

Both methods do the same thing i.e. send a file as the API response but there is a bit of difference in how they do it and how clients interpret the responses from both these methods.

If you'd like to be more hands-on while reading this blog post, you can clone or download <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/download-files-node-express-tutorial" target="_blank">this github tutorial</a> which has the complete code referenced below.

## Using `res.sendFile()`

For example:

```js
app.get( "/sendfile", ( req, res ) => {
  res.sendFile( path.join( __dirname + '/images/car.jpg' ) );
});
```

This method will indicate to the client that the file should be opened or displayed rather than downloaded. 

If you call this API service from a browser, the browser will directly display the image on the screen.

If you replace the image being sent in the response with a PDF file, the browser will open that PDF file in a new tab.

If you check the headers in the response, you'll see that the `Content-Type` header has been automatically set to the mime type of the file sent. In this case, it has been set to `image/jpeg`.

## Using `res.download()`

For example:

```js
app.get( "/download", ( req, res ) => {
  res.download( path.join( __dirname + '/images/car.jpg' ) );
});
```

This method will indicate to the client that the file should be downloaded and will prompt the user for download.

If you call this API service from a browser, the browser will download this image instead of displaying it on the screen.

If you replace the image being sent in the response with a PDF file, the browser will download the file instead of opening that PDF file in a new tab.

If you check the headers in the response, you'll see that the `Content-Type` header has been automatically set to the mime type of the file sent. But additionally, this method also sets the `Content-Disposition` header to indicate that this file is an attachment along with the file name.
