Usually, an `UPDATE` statement references columns from the one table that it is updating.

But sometimes, you may need to update one table with data from another table. In such scenarios, you may need the ability to UPDATE this table with a SELECT clause that selects rows from another table.

Consider the example below. The context is that of a shopping cart where the user selects a shipping address from one of his several saved addresses. This selected saved address needs to be copied over to the shopping cart table into the shipping address columns.

So the problem here is that we want to execute an UPDATE statement on the `tbl_shopping_cart` table but we want to source the data from the `tbl_saved_addersses` table.

Lets see how we can construct the `UPDATE` query to achieve this.

```
UPDATE 
    c
SET
    c.shipping_name = sa.name,
    c.shipping_addr1 = sa.addr1,
    c.shipping_addr2 = sa.addr2,
    c.shipping_city = sa.city,
    c.shipping_state = sa.state,
    c.shipping_zip = sa.zip,
    c.shipping_country = sa.country
FROM
    tbl_shopping_cart c
    INNER JOIN tbl_saved_addresses sa ON c.userid = sa.userid 
WHERE
    sa.id = @p_selected_shipping_address_id
    AND c.id = @p_shopping_cart_id;
```

Normally, we'd have the `UPDATE-SET-WHERE` construct but here we have a `UPDATE-SET-FROM-WHERE` construct. The `FROM` clause is where we specify all the tables involved. One of those tables will be specified after the `UPDATE` statement which will indicate that this is the table we want to update. All other tables will be used to source data.

The params `@p_selected_shipping_address_id` and `@p_shopping_cart_id` indicate placeholder variables used for demo purposes.

Hope this helps!üôè
