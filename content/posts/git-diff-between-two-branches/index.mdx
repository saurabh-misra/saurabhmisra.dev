We usually use `git diff` to compare the committed version and the working copy version of the file in the same branch to view what has changed.

In this article, we'll learn how to compare files between two different branches with `git diff`.

This can be useful when you want to merge one branch with another but want to compare what has changed prior to the merge.

Here is the syntax for comparing files between two different branches. First checkout one of the branches in this case named `branch1`.

```bash
git checkout branch1
```

Next, use the below command to compare a file called `file.txt` with another branch called `branch2`.

```bash
git diff branch2 -- file.txt
```

You can similarly compare multiple files like this:

```bash
git diff branch2 -- file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

You can also compare all files within the current directory using the below command:

```bash
git diff branch2 -- .
```

Or you can specify a path and compare all files within that path.

```bash
git diff branch2 -- ./path/to/files/
```

Hope this helps!üôè
