**In this post, we're going to look at two different approaches for automatically scrolling to an element in React. We'll also look at how to handle scrolling when the page has a fixed DOM element like a nav bar.**

>This tutorial assumes basic working knowledge of React. The tutorial also uses CSS classes and components from the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> library.

There are two different ways to achieve automatic scrolling:

1. Using `useRef()` and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView" target="_blank">`scrollIntoView()`</a>.
2. Using `useRef()`, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollTo" target="_blank">`window.scrollTo()`</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect" target="_blank">`getBoundingClientRect()`</a>.

## Tutorial Project Setup
Download or clone the tutorial codebase from <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/react-auto-scroll-to-element-tutorial" target="_blank">this github repo</a>. Once you have it locally, open your terminal and run `npm i` to install dependencies and then `npm run dev` to start a localhost server. Visit the localhost URL to view the solution in action.

We'll go over some of the boilerplate code from the codebase and get it out of the way before we proceed to examining the specific solutions for scrolling.

We have an `App.jsx` file that does some basic routing and renders our pages. It also displays a navigation bar with links to pages that demonstrate our solutions for automatic scrolling.

```jsx title=/src/App.jsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import ScrollIntoView from './ScrollIntoView';
import ScrollIntoViewNavbar from './ScrollIntoViewNavbar';
import ScrollTo from './ScrollTo';

export default function App() {
    const navbarRef = useRef( null );

    // conditionally display pages based on the URL path
    let page = <ScrollIntoView />;
    let fixedNavbar = false;
    if( location.pathname == "/scrollintoviewnavbar" ) {
        page = <ScrollIntoViewNavbar />;
        fixedNavbar = true;
    } else if ( location.pathname == "/scrollto" ) {
        page = <ScrollTo navbarRef={navbarRef} />;
        fixedNavbar = true;
    }

    return (
        <>
            <nav ref={navbarRef} className={`${ fixedNavbar && "sticky-top"} navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary`}>
                <div className="container">
                    <ul className="navbar-nav">
                        <li className="nav-item">
                            <a href="/" className="nav-link">
                                ScrollIntoView
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li className="nav-item">
                            <a href="/scrollintoviewnavbar" className="nav-link">
                                ScrollIntoView+FixedNavbar
                            </a>
                        </li>
                        <li className="nav-item">
                            <a href="/scrollto" className="nav-link">
                                ScrollTo
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </nav>

            { page }
        </>
    );
}
```

You'll notice the nav bar has links to three pages: 
1. The "ScrollIntoView" nav bar link opens the localhost root ( "/" ) which renders the `<ScrollIntoView />` component. This page will demonstrate our scrolling solution using `scrollIntoView()` and a nav bar which is not fixed.
2. The "ScrollIntoView+FixedNavbar" nav bar link opens `/scrollintoviewnavbar` page which renders the `<ScrollIntoViewNavbar />` component. This page will demonstrate the same scrolling solution using `scrollIntoView()` as the first page but with a fixed nav bar.
3. Lastly, the "ScrollTo" nav bar link opens `/scrollto` page which renders the `<ScrollTo />` component. This page will demonstrate our scrolling solution using `window.scrollTo()` and `getBoundingClientRect()` and a fixed navbar.

Each of these three pages render ten `<Card />` components one below the other. Each page has a script that automatically scrolls the page to card #5.

Lets look at each of these pages and how the automatic scrolling is implemented and works within each of them.

## Using `useRef()` and `scrollIntoView()`

If you visit the localhost root or click on the first nav menu link "ScrollIntoView", you'll notice that the page loads and smoothly scrolls to card #5 and positions it perfectly at the top of the browser window.

Also note that the navbar in this case is not fixed which is why it gets scrolled up out of view.

<img src={scrollIntoView} className="output-screenshots" alt="browser screencast showing how scrollIntoView() automatically scrolls the page on page load." />

Lets look at the code of the `<ScrollIntoView />` page component.

```jsx title=/src/ScrollIntoView.jsx highlight=6-7,16,20-25
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import Card from "./Card";

export default function ScrollIntoView() {
    // create a `ref` to the Card component to which we want to scroll to.
    const scrollToRef = useRef( null );
    const scrollToCardNum = 5;

    // Create an array of Card components
    const items = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    const cards = items.map( i => (
        <Card cardNum={i} key={i} 
            className="bg-primary-subtle"
            // If we should scroll to this card component, 
            // then pass `scrollToRef` else pass `null`  
            ref={ i === scrollToCardNum ? scrollToRef : null } 
        />
    ));
    
    useEffect( () => {
        // If `scrollToRef` points to an element, then scroll it into view.
        if( scrollToRef.current ) {
            scrollToRef.current.scrollIntoView();
        }
    }, []);

    return (
        <div className="container my-5">
            <div className="row">
                <div className="col">
                    {cards}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

The basic idea here is that we create a `ref` named `scrollToRef` and we identify the 5th `<Card />` component as the one we want to scroll to. So we pass it this `ref` and then in a `useEffect()`, we use `scrollIntoView()` to scroll to that component. Pretty straight-forward!

>Did you notice we passed `scrollToRef` to `<Card />` using the `ref` prop even though `ref`s cannot be assigned to custom components? We're able to do this because we wrapped the `<Card />` component definition with a <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef" target="_blank">`forwardRef()`</a>. 

### Fixed nav bar issue

Now lets see how this same solution fares when there is a fixed Nav Bar on the page.

Click on the second nav bar link named "ScrollIntoView+FixedNavbar". You'll notice that the page loads and again smoothly scrolls to card #5 but in this case, the card does not seem to be properly positioned. Some portion of the card goes under the nav bar.

<img src={scrollIntoViewWithNavbar} className="output-screenshots" alt="browser screencast showing how scrollIntoView() automatically scrolls the page but the element being scrolled to goes under the fixed navigation bar." />

This happens because `scrollIntoView()` does not consider the fact that a certain portion of the page is not being scrolled and scrolls "too far". We need to be able to customize or have more control over the scroll distance. 

This is where `scrollTo()` comes into play. Let see how we can use it to resolve this issue.

## Using `useRef()` and `window.scrollTo()` with fixed NavBar

Click on the third nav bar link named "ScrollTo". You'll notice that even though the page has a fixed nav bar, the page still smoothly scrolls and positions card #5 perfectly just below the nav bar. 

<img src={scrollTo} className="output-screenshots" alt="browser screencast showing how scrollIntoView() automatically scrolls the page but the element being scrolled to goes under the fixed navigation bar." />

Lets see the code for this in `/src/ScrollTo.jsx`.

```jsx title=/src/ScrollTo.jsx highlight=20-30
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import Card from "./Card";

export default function ScrollTo({ navbarRef }) {
    // create a `ref` to the Card component to which we want to scroll to.
    const scrollToRef = useRef( null );
    const scrollToCardNum = 5;

    // Create an array of Card components
    const items = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
    const cards = items.map( i => (
        <Card cardNum={i} key={i} 
            className="bg-primary-subtle"  
            // If we should scroll to this card component, 
            // then pass `scrollToRef` else pass `null`  
            ref={ i === scrollToCardNum ? scrollToRef : null } 
        />
    ));

    useEffect( () => {
        // If `scrollToRef` points to an element, then scroll it into view.
        if( scrollToRef.current ) {
            // Get the height of the fixed nav bar.
            const navbarHeight = navbarRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().height;
            // Calculate the distance to be scrolled.
            const scrollPosY = scrollToRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().top - navbarHeight;
            // scroll away!
            window.scrollTo( 0, scrollPosY );            
        }
    }, []);

    return (
        <div className="container my-5">
            <div className="row">
                <div className="col">
                    {cards}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

The only change here is that we are calculating the distance to be scrolled. This calculation takes into account the top position of card #5 and the navbar height. 

The method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect" target="_blank">`getBoundingClientRect()`</a> calculates various positional parameters for the element in question and `top` is one of them. This gives the distance in pixels between the top of the page and the top edge of the card. 

Remember in the previous section with the fixed nav bar where we mentioned that `scrollIntoView()` scrolls "too far". This is why in this solution, we subtract the navbar height from the total distance to be scrolled so that `scrollTo()` doesn't scroll "too far".

## Summary

There are two approaches to automatically scroll to an element on the page in React.

1. Using `useRef()` and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView" target="_blank">`scrollIntoView()`</a>.
2. Using `useRef()`, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollTo" target="_blank">`window.scrollTo()`</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect" target="_blank">`getBoundingClientRect()`</a>.

You can use the first method if there is no fixed nav bar on the page. If there is a fixed nav bar then you should use the second approach.

Hope this helps!🙏
