This blog post serves as a quick reference aka cheatsheet( primarily intended for my future self ), to understand the syntactic peculiarities of the ES6 style of module exports with a quick glance.

## DEFAULT EXPORT & IMPORT

Export an anonymous function as default and then import it with a name.

```js
export default function(){ ... };

import anyName from '...';
```

Export an anonymous arrow function as default and then import it with a name.
```js
export default () => { ... };

import anyName from '...';
```

Export a function as default after it has been declared and then import it with a name.

```js
function foo(){ 
  ... 
}
export default foo;

import anyName from '...';
```

Export a variable as default after it has been declared and then import it with a name.

```js
const foo = () => { ... };
export default foo;

import anyName from '...';
```

Another way to export a variable as default and then import it with a name.
```js
export { foo as default };

import anyName from '...';
```

Default + Named export followed by a Default + Named import.

```js
export { foo as default, bar };

import { default as anyName, bar } from '...';
```

## NAMED EXPORT & IMPORT

Export inline with each declaration.

```js
export const foo = () => { ... };

export function bar(){ ... };
```

Export at the end after all declarations

```js
const foo = () => { ... };
function bar(){ ... };

export { foo, bar };
```

Import a single export.

```js
import { foo } from '...';
```

Import multiple exports.

```js
import { foo, bar } from '...';
```

## IMPORT ALL

Import everything into an object. All exports will be referenced as the object properties including the default export.

```js
import * as obj from '...';

obj.default();
obj.bar();
```

You can also name the default during import and also import all named exports into an object.
```js
import foo, * as obj from '...';

foo();
obj.default();
obj.bar();
```

## RENAMING EXPORTS & IMPORTS

Rename during export and then import as is.

```js
export { foo, bar as baz };

import { foo, baz } from '...';
```

Export as is and then rename during import.
```js
export { foo, bar };

import { foo, bar as baz } from '...';
```

## MIXED EXPORT & IMPORT

Export some functions inline and others post declaration in the same module.

```js
// export inline
export default () => { ... };
export const bar = () => { ... };

// export after declaration
function baz(){ ... }
export { baz };
```

Then during import, name the default, do a named as well as a renamed export.

```js
import { default as foo, bar, baz as pie } from '...';
foo(); bar(); pie();
```

## RE-EXPORT USING `export from ...`

We'll be using two modules: `first.js` and `second.js`. The latter will re-export or *forward* the exports from the former. 

```js title=first.js
export { foo as default, bar, baz };
```

In `second.js`, we'll do a simple re-export of only the default.

```js title=second.js
export { default } from 'first.js';
```

And then import the default from `second.js` like we have seen before.

```js
import foo from 'second.js';
```

Next, we'll re-export the default along with another named export.

```js title=second.js
export { default, bar } from 'first.js';
```

And then we'll do a named import of both.

```js
import { default as foo, bar } from 'second.js';
```

Next, in `second.js`, we'll add a renamed export to the mix.

```js title=second.js
export { default, bar, baz as pie } from 'first.js';
```

And then we'll do a named import of all the three forwarded exports.

```js
import foo, { bar, pie } from 'second.js';
```
