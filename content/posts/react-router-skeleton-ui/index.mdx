I am sure you have used <a href="https://youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a> on your phone or in a browser. You must have noticed that for the initial couple of seconds, you see these gray-ish placeholder video thumbnails and then after those couple of seconds, they are replaced by the actual video thumbnail. 

Such a UI is known as a skeleton UI and is extremely effective as a visual cue to indicate that the page is loading.

As another example, see the screenshot below. This is a <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/placeholders/#example" target="_blank">Card placedholder UI component provided by the popular CSS library Bootstrap</a>. We're going to use this Card component in this tutorial for implementing a skeleton UI.

By default, React Router does not render any UI unless the `loader()` finishes loading data. But it <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main/guides/deferred" target="_blank">provides options to workaround this default behaviour and render something while the data is loading</a>.

**In this tutorial, we're going to workaround React Router's default `loader()` behaviour using React Router features `defer` and `Await` and React Suspense to show localized loading indicators or skeleton UIs or placeholder UIs while the data is being loaded.**

>This tutorial assumes you have some basic knowledge of working with React Router.

## Tutorial Project Setup

We're going to build a two page web-app using React Router. The **Default page** will use the default loading behaviour of React Router and the **Skeleton page** will use localized skeleton UIs to indicate that the page content is loading. This will enable you to contrast both techniques.

Go ahead and download or clone the tutorial project from <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-misra/react-router-skeleton-ui-tutorial" target="_blank">this github repo</a>.

Once downloaded, open your terminal and `cd` into the root of the github repo folder. Next, run `npm i` to install dependencies namely React, React Router and Bootstrap. Once these dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev` to spin up the server on localhost. Go ahead and visit the localhost url in your browser.

You should see the home page. Nothing to see here except the nav menu. 

<img src={browserScreenshotHomePage} className="output-screenshots" alt="browser screenshot showing the tutorial Home page with nav links to the Default and Skeleton page." />

Go ahead and click on the Default page. You won't see anything for a couple of seconds. After a couple of seconds, you'll see the heading and the Card component with data. 

<img src={browserScreenshotDefaultPage} className="output-screenshots" alt="browser screenshot showing the Default page rendered after a couple of seconds." />

The delay in rendering the Default page is because the `loader()` is *loading* data from the API and in the meantime, it doesn't render anything. Once the API returns a response, the `loader()` returns the data and begins rendering the route component `<DefaultComponent>`.

Now go ahead and click on the Skeleton link in the nav menu. In this case, the UI changes immediately to show a placeholder skeleton Card component and after a couple of seconds you see the actual Card component with data. This is certainly much better UX as compared to the Default page.

<img src={browserScreenshotSkeletonPageLoaded} className="output-screenshots" alt="browser screenshot showing the Skeleton page completed rendered and the skeleton Card UI element replaced by the actual data-hydrated Card UI element." />

Lets go over the actual code used to implement this skeleton UI.

## The default loading behavior

This is the entire contents of the `/src/DefaultPage.jsx` route component. 

```js title=/src/DefaultPage.jsx
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";
import Card from "./Card";
import getData from "./api";

export async function loader() {
    return await getData();
}

export default function DefaultPage() {
    const data = useLoaderData();

    return (
        <>
            <div className="container mt-5">
                <div className="row">
                    <div className="col">
                        <h1>Default Page</h1>
                        <Card {...data} width="300px" />
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

When you visit the `/default` route, the `loader()` gets called. It invokes an API request but has to wait for the response because we have used an `await`. Till then, it does not render any UI. When the data arrives, the promise gets resolved and the `loader()` returns the resolved `data` and starts rendering the `<Card>` UI. This is why we don't see any changes in the UI and it appears like nothing is happening for a couple of seconds after we click on the Default Page nav link.

## Implementing the skeleton UI

This is the entire contents of the `SkeletonPage.jsx` component.

```js title=/src/SkeletonPage.jsx highlight=8,20-26
import React from "react";
import { Await, defer, useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";
import Card from "./Card";
import CardSkeleton from "./CardSkeleton";
import getData from "./api";

export function loader() {
    return defer({ data: getData() })
}

export default function SkeletonPage() {
    const { data } = useLoaderData();

    return (
        <>
            <div className="container mt-5">
                <div className="row">
                    <div className="col">
                        <h1>Skeleton Page</h1>
                        <React.Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton width="300px" /> }>
                            <Await resolve={data} errorElement={<p>Error!</p>}>
                                {
                                    (data) => <Card {...data} width="300px" />
                                }
                            </Await>
                        </React.Suspense>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

Did you notice how we have used `defer()` to return a Promise from our `loader()` instead of a resolved value? Since the `loader()` doesn't wait for the API call to complete( or the promise to resolve ), it immediately returns and begins rendering the route component i.e. `<SkeletonPage>`.

Inside the route component, we use the `fallback` attribute of `<React.Suspense>` to render the skeleton UI `<CardSkeleton>` component.

When the Promise resolves, the `data` from the `loader()` response is used to render the actual `<Card>` component. If the Promise rejects, `<Await>` also provides a way to show an error UI element using the `errorElement` attribute.

And that's all that there is to it!ü§ò

Hope this helps!üôè
