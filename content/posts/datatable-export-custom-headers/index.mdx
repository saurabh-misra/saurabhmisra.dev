Exporting as excel in a DataTable configured table is pretty straight forward. But what if we want to change the header while exporting as excel so that the web view has a different header and the excel has a different one.

But why would anyone need to do that? Well lets take the example from this [previous post](/add-dropdown-filter-header-datatable-jquery) where the table has a `<select>` filter in the header instead of a column name. We definitely need the column name as the header in the excel file so lets try to do that.

To achieve this, we need to add the below code to the initialization object.

```js
...
"buttons": [{
  "extend": 'excel',
  "exportOptions": {
    "format": {
      "header": function(content, index) {
        // Here 2 is the index of the column 
        // whose header name we want to change(0 based)
        return index === 2 ? "Gender" : content;
      }
    }
  }
}]
...
```
