Exporting as excel in a DataTable configured table is pretty straight forward. But what if we want to change the header while exporting as excel so that the web view has a different header and the excel has a different one.

But why would anyone need to do that? 

### The Problem...
Well lets take the example from this [previous post](/jquery-datatable-plugin-add-dropdown-search-filter-header) where the table has a `<select>` filter in the header instead of a column name. 

<img src="/datatable-export-custom-headers-1.jpg" class="output-screenshots" alt="datatable with a dropdown filter in the column header" />

Exporting this datatable as an excel file will generate something like this:

<img src="/datatable-export-custom-headers-2.jpg" class="output-screenshots" alt="exported excel from datatable with dropdown options as column header" />

As you can see, the options in the filter dropdown become the header text in the excel.

### The Solution...
We definitely need a better column name as the header in the excel file so lets try to do that. To achieve this, we need to add the below code to the initialization object.

```js
...
"buttons": [{
  "extend": 'excel',
  "exportOptions": {
    "format": {
      "header": function(content, index) {
        // Here 2 is the index of the column 
        // whose header name we want to change(0 based)
        return index === 2 ? "Gender" : content;
      }
    }
  }
}]
...
```

After adding the above code, we get the desired header text in the column.
