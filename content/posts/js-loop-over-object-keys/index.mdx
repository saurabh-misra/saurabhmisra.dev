In this tutorial, we're going to look at 3 different ways to loop over the keys in a JavaScript object. 

These methods are:

1. The `for-in` loop
2. The `for-of` loop with `Object.keys()`
3. The `for-of` loop with `Object.entries()`

In the examples that follow, we'll be using the JS object below.

```js
const user = {
    user_id: 123,
    name: "Saurabh Misra",
    email: "hello@saurabhmisra.dev"
}
```

## The `for-in` loop

This is how we can use the `for-in` construct to loop over all the keys in an object.

```js
for( var key in user ) {
    if( user.hasOwnProperty( key ) ) {
        console.log( key );
    }
}

/*
user_id
name
email
*/
```

Notice the `if` condition with the `hasOwnProperty()` call. If you do not specify this condition then the `for-in` loop will not only loop over all the immediate properties in the object but will also loop over all the objects and properties nested in the prototype chain.

Consider this example where the object `employee` has the object `user` in its prototype chain. If you do not specify the `hasOwnProperty()` condition, then the `for-in` loop will display all properties within the `employee` object and then all properties within the `user` object as well.

```js
function Employee(){
    this.employee_id = "123";
}

Employee.prototype = user;

const employee = new Employee();

for( var key in employee ) {
    console.log( key );
}

/*
employee_id 
user_id 
name 
email
*/
```

If this is what you want then you can omit the condition but otherwise make sure you specify this condition.

## The `for-of` loop with `Object.keys()`

```js
for( var key of Object.keys( user ) ) {
    console.log( key );
}

/*
user_id
name
email
*/
```

## The `for-of` loop with `Object.entries()`

```js
for( var [key, value] of Object.entries( user ) ) {
    console.log( key );
}

/*
user_id
name
email
*/
```

Hope this helps!üôè
